# Russ Williams, Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect
#### The following are examples of work Russ Williams has done in his role as a Microsoft CSA.  Examples include solution accelerators, sample application, product features, and community speaking

* ***Contact Center Solution Accelerator*** - Worked closely with the engineering, marketing, and product management teams from PVA, Bot Framework, and AudioCodes as I created a strategically aligned contact center accelerator that minimizes the time-to-value and maximizes the capability of the resulting contact center solution.  This accelerator has been added to the Data & AI Toolkit used by Microsoft World-wide Industry Solutions group (aka MCS) to drive contact center consulting engagements and there are plans to publish it as a Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) accelerator for Cloud Solution Architects and Microsoft partners to use in their enterprise engagement work.  There are also plans for AudioCodes to incorporate this accelerator into their documentation and build a consulting business around it.

* ***LivePerson Bot-as-a-Proxy Product Feature*** - Create bot-as-a-proxy sample that was Pull-Requested into the official Microsoft Bot Framework samples repo that demonstrates how to use the Bot Framework Handoff APIs and the LivePerson Agent Hub to integrate human agent escalation with the Virtual Assistant Template.

* ***Bot Accelerator Workshop*** – This workshop was early work I did to accelerate Bot Framework adoption with enterprise customers and centers around the old Virtual Assistant Template that drove the early days of code-first development with our BF stack

* ***ACS Engagement Hub Sample Application*** – Work as an embedded engineering resource in the ACS Job Router team (Job Router is in private preview) building an ACS Job Router-based PVA Engagement Hub reference application that uses agent escalation to showcase Job Router capabilities.  My role was to build the agent escalation capability through a custom PVA engagement hub implementation.  This reference application will be published in their GA timeframe.

* ***Conversational Apps*** – This is proof-of-concept I created a couple of years ago for what I think is a new category of application.  This is something that I plan to revisit now that .NET MAUI is almost here and we have the new ACS UI for Mobile SDK and the ACS Chat for Bots capability (private preview)  
**Concept**: http://aka.ms/capps

* ***Intro to C-AI for Enterprise Customers*** – Created this light-hearted introductory video for enterprise customers when Microsoft first released the Bot Framework.  Conversation AI was a foreign concept back then to most enterprise decision makers

* ***COVID Bot Accelerator*** – This is a Q&A accelerator I create for the Microsoft State & Local OU to help states in the US build COVID Q&A bot quickly  
**Repo**: https://github.com/managedcoder/slg-covid-bot

* ***Early Snippets for Enterprise Customers*** – This repo captured “how-to’s” for early gaps and rough spots in the Bot Framework when it was first released and those “building blocks” formed the beginning of my accelerator work on the Microsoft Conversational AI stack
